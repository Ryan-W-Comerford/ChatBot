# Chat Bot

Created a high-level Chat Bot using Java to display my knowledge of OOP, HashMaps, randomization, string parsing, and more. Will possibly add machine learning model in the future for more complicated responses.

# How to Run

Simply type "./run.sh" in the terminal and it will both compile and run the program. For compiling errors, check both jdk is installed and configured properly. For permissions issues on the "run.sh" file, try "chmod +x run.sh", to give execution permission to the file.

After running, you should see the message "Hi I'm A Bot! What's Up?". You can then type your responses to chat.
